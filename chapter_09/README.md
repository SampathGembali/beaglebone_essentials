=============================================

Here the code from chapter 9 - "Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)" of
the book "BeagleBone Essentials" written by Rodolfo Giometti and
published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78439-352-6).

This example code implements a program to read data from an SPI device and
some DTS files in order to support some SPI devices.

* BB-SPIDEV0-1M-00A0.dts: DTS file for the ADC MCP322 device

* cape-bone-adafruit-lcd-00A0.dts: DTS file for the LCD ST7735 device

* spi_thermo: a program to manage the Thermocouple MAX31855
