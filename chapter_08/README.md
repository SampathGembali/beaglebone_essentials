==========================================

Here the code from chapter 8 - "Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)" of
the book "BeagleBone Essentials" written by Rodolfo Giometti and
published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78439-352-6).

This example code implements a program to read data from an I2C device and
two DTS files in order to support two I2C devices.

* BB-ADC-MCP322-00A0.dts: DTS file for the ADC MCP322 device

* BB-EEPROM-A24-00A0.dts: DTS file for the EEPROM A24 device

* i2c_dac: a program to manage the DAC TC1321
